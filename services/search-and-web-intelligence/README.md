# Search & Web Intelligence Services

> Services that give AI agents **optimized, structured access to web information** — returning AI-ready content tuned for LLM context windows, not raw HTML or human-readable SERPs.

## Why This Category Exists

Traditional search APIs (Google Custom Search, Bing Search API) were designed to return results a human would display in a browser. The output format — ranked blue links, snippet strings, raw HTML — was designed for human eyes and requires significant postprocessing before an LLM can use it effectively.

AI agents have fundamentally different search requirements:

1. **Clean text output** — not HTML, not truncated snippets, but full readable content
2. **Pre-ranked relevance** — results already filtered for the agent's query, not a SERP for a human to scan
3. **Configurable depth** — some queries need surface-level summaries; others need deep multi-source synthesis
4. **Domain-specific search** — coding agents need code/documentation; research agents need academic papers
5. **Structured extraction** — not just "here's the page" but "here's the entity data you requested, as JSON"

The services in this category were designed with these requirements as the primary specification.

## Criteria Reminder

To qualify for this category, a service must:

1. Return **LLM-ready content** — not raw HTML or human-formatted SERPs.
2. Use a **ranking model tuned for agent consumption**, not human click-through.
3. Support **structured extraction** or **schema-based output** as a first-class feature.
4. Provide **configurable depth** — surface search, deep extraction, or multi-step research.
5. Have a **machine-to-machine API** as the primary interface.
